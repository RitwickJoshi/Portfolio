# Portfolio
This is a Portfolio of My journey in programming
This is **Work-In-Progress build**

# [Project 1: Salary Predictor](https://github.com/RitwickJoshi/Data-Science-Project)
## Description
* Created a Tool that estimates data science salaries to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scrapped over 400 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium.
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridSearchCV to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing API using Flask and hosted on heroku

# [Project 2: Artificial Intelligence Alice](https://github.com/RitwickJoshi/Artifical-Intelligence-Project-trial)
* This project simulates a AI named "ALICE" that gives answers to the respective queries 
* It helps the User to do day-to-day task using voice commands such as:
  * "Run ABC file"
  * "Open XYZ folder"
  * "Play DEF music" - This requires you to add music into music folder in windows OS
  * "What is ABC/ETC ?"
* The AI also has a way to sleep just tell "Bye Alice" or "Shutdown Alice" Or wake up the Assistant by saying "Hey Alice"
